      <p>
        The basic doctrine of animal rights supporters is that every creature with a 
        will to live has a right to live free from pain and suffering. As the human 
        population continues to expand, we must take vital steps to cut thoughtless 
        animal cruelty out of our lives. Humane societies work to find homes for 
        animals as shelters become overcrowded and are forced to stretch their 
        resources to the brink. In addition to animal placement, these organizations 
        also work to rescue animals from abuse and neglect.

      <p>
        The Boko Haram insurgency has displaced nearly 2.4 million people in the 
        Lake Chad Basin. Although the Nigerian military has regained control in 
        parts of the countryâ€™s north-east, civilians in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad 
        and Niger continue to be affected by grave violations of human rights, 
        widespread sexual and gender-based violence, forced recruitment and suicide 
        bombings. The crisis has been exacerbated by conflict-induced food insecurity 
        and severe malnutrition, which have risen to critical levels in all four countries.

        Black Lives Matter began as a call to action in response to state-sanctioned 
        violence and anti-Black racism. Our intention from the very beginning was to 
        connect Black people from all over the world who have a shared desire for justice 
        to act together in their communities. The impetus for that commitment was, and 
        still is, the rampant and deliberate violence inflicted on us by the state.

        Child victims of trafficking are recruited, transported, transferred, harbored

        streets as child beggars, in wars as child soldiers, on farms, in traveling sales 
        crews or in restaurants and hotels. Some are forced to work in brothels and strip

        Most of the current warming trend is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent 
        probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century 
        and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia. Evidence 
        of rapid climate change includes warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, glacial 
        retreat, and ocean acidification. Limiting greenhouse gas emissions is vital to 
        curbing the significant, long-term effects of climate change such as lengthened 
        growing seasons, changes in precipitation patterns, stronger and more intense 
        hurricanes, and an ice-free Arctic.

        Since the Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted in 1990, many social barriers

      <p>
        A consequence of the widening income gap in the United States is its effects 
        on education in underserved communities. It is widely believed that education 
        is an important stepping stone for financial and personal success. However, 
        as it has been widely documented, students from underserved communities are 
        not being afforded the same opportunities as their peers in more affluent communities. 
        Organizations aim to bridge the education gap by providing students in underserved 
        communities with school supplies, academic support, leadership training, scholarships, 
        and financial and college advising.

        Advocates for gender equality believe in creating a just world where women and girls 
        have the same rights as men and boys. Organizations for this cause challenge ingrained 
        cultural assumptions and call out inequality. Social change often begins with legal 
        change and so they use the power of the law to create enduring equality for women and 
        girls everywhere. The goals of these organizations include achieving legal equality, ending
        sexual violence and sex trafficking, and ending harmful practices such as culturally normalized
        forms of violence or discrimination against women and girls.

        Every child deserves a healthy start in life. However, there are far too many starving 
        children in third world countries from around the world for whom hunger is a constant, 
        chronic pain. In sub-Saharan Africa, a shocking 28 million children are experiencing 
        stunted growth due to malnutrition. Stunting prevents children from developing to their 
        full potential mentally and physically, and it is largely irreversible. Stunting is not 
        the only form of malnutrition that affects children. Children who have severe acute malnutrition,
        the deadliest form of extreme hunger, can succumb to the disease in just a few days. Children 
        who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop.
